# Perception-of-Human-Survival-Process-
Perception of how humans began process of need satisfaction, population growth and ability to create technology for mass solutions.

        ie: wheel was invented to carry mass or large amounts of objects
        
To obtain perception of human survival process and psychological progression the interactive process of molecules in boy girl  must be in constant observation to contrast the interaction amongst the other species who inhabit the planet.

As living creatures we are able to grasp the perception of ascencion from a flat surface cell membrane such as crocodile to a vertical being such as a tree.

"The Splat Cell Theory" is the core circuit principle that allows PERCEPT CONNECT use rationalization to give the human species the understanding of how we progressed from single individual cells that ascended through the acquisition of reproductive energy within the environment 

                                                  TO 

Complex creatures creatures capable that was previously posssessed by the few individuals who could advance the creative and reproductive abilities and processes of their time.

As we create a catalog of expereinces, the capacity to store new information or perceive interactive progression based on which of our abilities the process or task utilizes gives us the physical and psychological opportunity to process energy unlike any other species.

As energy from the environment was recycled within the cells, ascension, extension and the ability to shape became possible. 

The advancement in physicality allowed for new perception abilities or "scanning" to become possible to further enable survival.

Scanning is the ability to use vision without the retrieval of survival experience from the catalog of experience.

The new physical and internal abilities allowed for all living organisms to start a new way of life as predatory instinct became available to enable indivdual progression.

As physical motion through space is commenced and environmental interaction begins thought processes is set to circuit through survival mode (wild predators) need acqusition (locate and gather crop or cattle) or network to in-ter-rest

Physical or solitary activities or tasks which person does for oneself.

Social

Aspects of perception can't be coneived due to processing of environment and energy stimulation due to the circular nature of habit and the lateral process of information distribution within institutions.

Perception of environment and need acqusition or prayer was used as motivation to roam, hunt and gather 

Perceptions began to clash as populations increased and individuals started to satisfy needs utilizing the same method

Once in population humans learned to use new capacities to learn survival skills such as relation, habit, shape, and value
